This Project is more of a legacy and hasn't been running anymore for a long time now. It's sort of a PoC to make something fun based on canvas, node and websockets. It did run for a bit, but never picked up any speed.

Maybe I'll revive it someday, maybe...

## Dev Setup
- install node && npm
- npm install grunt-cli -g
- npm install bower -g
- npm install nodemon -g

- Pull project
- go to project dir
- npm install
- cd ressources
- bower install
- cd ..
- grunt

now you have to run bin/www with nodemon. (-> nodemon bin/www)

If you are working with IntelliJ you can create an easier run configuration:
- edit configurations
- new node config (needs node plugin, install that quickly)
- check that img: http://imgur.com/sRpLCp7
